# KrisBase

This is KrisBase, an interactive GUI book inventory system. It has many features such as sorting, adding, searching, and much more! This was a very fun process building this application. Its written on IntelliJ IDEA CE IDE in Java programming language. I built it for my girlfriend for our one year anniversary. She really loves reading books and I thought it would be a cool project to build over the summer. The application has many features that all interact with one another. The hardest part of the application was the interacting with the JTables and the .txt files. The .jar file has 777 permissions for executing. This is the built aritfact. Please have the .txt files in the same directory(folder) as the .jar file. The books are stored continously in the .txt files. There are some implmentations of the application that are still a work in progress but the application itself runs smoothly. The login password is: Hello135!? Have fun!
